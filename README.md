# Turtle Space Invader Clone
Personal project following [Build a Python Turtle Game: Space Invaders Clone - Real Python](https://realpython.com/build-python-turtle-game-space-invaders-clone/)
The project leverages the `turtle` module.
<br>
If you don't know, Space Invaders, sounds crazy, but plain and simple you shoot the turtles down.
<br>
The game keeps track of:
  * a running timer
  * keeping track of score
  * game ends if:
    * alien reaches the bottom
    * or alien hits your ship

In addition, to the Real Python project, I included the ability for the alien falling speed to increase over time.
